Code challenge: Farm harvest management
Â© ExploreAI Academy

In this code challenge, we will assist a farmer in calculating the total harvest from two fields (wheat and potatoes) and the overall expenses and profits for this season.

Learning objectives
In this train, we will:

Understand how to perform basic arithmetic operations in a Jupyter notebook.
Know how to assign numerical values to variables.
Know how to use the print() function to display our results.

Instructions
This code challenge does not count for marks.
Do not add or remove cells in this notebook.
Answer the questions according to the specifications provided.
Use the given cell in each question to see if your function matches the expected outputs.

Challenge 1
Calculate the total harvest for the farmer.

total_kgs_wheat_harvest = 2050
total_kgs_potato_harvest = 3600

total_kgs_harvest = # add your code here
print("Total harvest in kilograms:", total_kgs_harvest)
Expected outputs:

Total harvest in kilograms: 5650

Challenge 2
Calculate the total expenses (in dollars) and print the result.

seed_expense = 650
labour_expense = 3070

total_expenses_dollars = # add your code here
print() # add your code here
Expected outputs:

Total expenses in dollars: 3720

Challenge 3
Calculate the total revenue (in dollars) and print the result.

price_per_kg_wheat = 2
price_per_kg_potato = 1.4

total_revenue_dollars = # add your code here
print() # add your code here
Expected outputs:

Total revenue in dollars: 9140

Challenge 4
Calculate the total profit (in dollars) and print the result.

total_profit_dollars = # add your code here
print() # add your code here
Expected outputs:

Total profit in dollars: 5420
